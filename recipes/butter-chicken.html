    <li>8 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
    <li>4 shallot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 white onion, chopped</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons butter</li>

    <li>4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>

    <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
    <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
    <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
